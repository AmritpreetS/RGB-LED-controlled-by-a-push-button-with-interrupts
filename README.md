# RGB-LED-controlled-by-a-push-button-with-interrupts

The goal of this project was to use the Arduino UNO R3 to control a RGB led to cycle between following states on the push of a button:
1.LED off
2.LED red colour on
3.LED green colour on
4.LED blue colour on
5.LED all colours on

After programming the Arduino board to control the RGB led to switch between different startes, Interrupts were implemented in the code.
